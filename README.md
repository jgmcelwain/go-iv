# [pvpiv.app](https://pvpiv.app) - IV Checker for Pok√©mon GO

pvpiv.app allows trainers to quickly evaluate the value of a catch and determine if its IV spread would be beneficial in any league. All three leagues, as well as all four level caps within each, are displayed simultaneously. This allows easier identification of good spreads without having to manually adjust league/level cap settings.
